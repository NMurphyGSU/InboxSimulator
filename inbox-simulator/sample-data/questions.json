            "question": "Hello [FirstName],\n\n Congratulations again on completing your MBA. As we discussed at your party, the company is considering re-allocating professional development dollars away from tuition reimbursement for graduate degrees to more personalized, AI-driven, and in-house offerings. You are the most recent MBA graduate in the company, so you get to be the test subject for our leadership team as we finalize decisions. No pressure!\n\n Different members of the leadership team will email you questions pertaining to your MBA degree. Please answer the questions to the best of your abilities using whatever supporting material and resources you'd like.\n\n Let's start things off simply. There is some semantic confusion regarding different 'types' of strategies that we consider and develop here.\n\n When we are developing plans that emphasize improvement of the competitive position of our firm's products and services in a particular industry or market segment, what 'type' of strategy are we considering?",
